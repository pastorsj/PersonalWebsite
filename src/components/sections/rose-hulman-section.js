              While attending the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I developed a keen interest in software and
              digital solutions. I double-majored in Software Engineering and Computer Science and had two minors in
              Economics and Mathematics. I also worked part-time in the Rose-Hulmanâ€™s software department and focused
              primarily on web application development. This led to my first position post-graduation in Software
              Consulting for DMI, developing commercial web applications.

              While at Rose-Hulman, I was also student-athlete on the Varsity Golf team. I proudly competed for my
              university for 4 years. I was recognized by the Golf Coaches Association of America as an All America
              Scholar in 2016. Golf was and continues to be a great passion in my life.
