              While attending the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I developed a keen interest in software and
              digital solutions. I double-majored in Software Engineering and Computer Science and had two minors in
              Economics and Mathematics and graduated Magna Cum Laude. I also worked part-time in the Rose-Hulmanâ€™s
              software department and focused primarily on web application development.

              While at Rose-Hulman, I was also student-athlete on the Varsity Golf team. I proudly competed for my
              university for 4 years. I represented Rose-Hulman at the conference championships 3 times, played 65
              competitive rounds, and finished with an average of 79.4. I was recognized by the Golf Coaches Association
              of America as an All America Scholar in 2016. Golf was and continues to be a great passion in my life.
