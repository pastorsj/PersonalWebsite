              I attended Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a keen interest in software. I double majored in
              Software Engineering and Computer Science and double minored in Economics and Mathematics. While working
              in software department, I primarily focused on web application development, which led to my first job in
              software consultanting at DMI developing commerical web applications.

              While at Rose-Hulman, I was a 4 year varsity athlete playing golf. I was recognized by the Golf Coaches
              Association of America as an All America Scholar in 2016. Golf has always been and continues to be a
              passion that I share with as many people as possible.
