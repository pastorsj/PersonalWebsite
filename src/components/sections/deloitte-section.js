              During my time at Deloitte, I developed a custom python package that measures the performance of machine
              learning and neural network models using a combination of metrics and visualizations to increase the
              explainability and transparency of models developed at Deloitte's AI Center of Excellence. Additionally, I
              integrated this package with two production-level projects. I also built out infrastructure around this
              project, including a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that ran unit and integration tests and automatic documentation
              generation using Sphinx.

              In addition to managing the development process of this package, I also presented the final product to
              more than 50 people at AI Center of Excellence. I also personally presented to the Deloitte AI Design
              Council, consisting of AI leaders across the CoE. Finally, I held weekly code reviews with Master Data
              Scientists at the CoE to get feedback on the product, both from a code quality and architecture
              perspective.
